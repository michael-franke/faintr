## Overview

The **faintr** (FActorINTerpreteR) package provides convenience functions for 
interpreting [**brms**](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/) model fits for data 
from factorial designs. It allows for the extraction and comparison of posterior 
draws for a given design cell, irrespective of the encoding scheme used in the model.

Currently, **faintr** provides the following functions:

* `get_cell_definitions` returns information on the predictor variables and how 
they are encoded in the model.
* `extract_cell_draws` returns posterior draws and additional metadata
for all design cells.
* `filter_cell_draws` returns posterior draws and additional metadata
for one subset of design cells.
* `compare_groups` returns summary statistics of comparing two subsets of design cells.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("michael-franke/faintr")
```

## Examples

In this section, we shortly introduce how to use the package. For a more detailed 
overview, please refer to the [vignette](https://michael-franke.github.io/faintr/articles/faintr_basics.html).

We will use a preprocessed version of the mouse-tracking data set from the [**aida**](https://github.com/michael-franke/aida-package) package:

```{r data-import, echo=FALSE}
data <- aida::data_MT

data <- data %>% 
  mutate(
    prototype_label = case_when(
      prototype_label %in% c('curved', 'straight') ~ prototype_label,
      TRUE ~ 'CoM'
      ),
    prototype_label = factor(prototype_label,
                             levels = c('straight', 'curved', 'CoM')))
```

```{r data}
data %>% 
  select(RT, group, condition, prototype_label) %>%
  head()
```

The variables relevant for us are:

* `RT`: Reaction time in milliseconds
* `group`: Whether a category is selected by click vs touch
* `condition`: Whether the animal is a typical vs atypical representative of its category
* `prototype_label`: The type of prototypical movement strategy (straight vs curved vs CoM)

Below, we regress the log-transformed reaction times as a function of factors 
`group`, `condition`, `prototype_label`, and their three-way interaction using a 
linear regression model fitted with [**brms**](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/):

```{r model-fitting, results='hide'}
fit <- brms::brm(formula = log(RT) ~ group * condition * prototype_label,
                 data = data,
                 seed = 123
                 )
```

To obtain information on the factors and the coding scheme used in the model, 
we can use `get_cell_definitions`:

```{r cell-defs}
get_cell_definitions(fit)
```

The output shows that factors `group`, `condition` and `prototype_label` are
dummy-coded, with `click`, `Atypical`, and `straight` being the reference levels, respectively.

To extract posterior draws for all design cells, we can use `extract_cell_draws`:

```{r extract-cell-draws}
extract_cell_draws(fit)
```

With `filter_cell_draws` we can obtain posterior draws for a specific design cell.
For instance, draws for typical exemplars in click trials, averaged over factor `prototype_label`,
can be extracted like so:

```{r filter-cell-draws}
filter_cell_draws(fit, condition == "Typical" & group == "click")
```

Parameter `colname` allows changing the default column name in the output, which
facilitates post-processing of cell draws, e.g., for plotting or summary statistics.
Here, we extract the draws for each level of `prototype_label` (averaged over `group` 
and `condition`) and visualize the results:

```{r plot, out.width="70%"}
draws_straight <- filter_cell_draws(fit, prototype_label == "straight", colname = "straight")
draws_curved <- filter_cell_draws(fit, prototype_label == "curved", colname = "curved")
draws_CoM <- filter_cell_draws(fit, prototype_label == "CoM", colname = "CoM")

draws_prototype <- posterior::bind_draws(draws_straight, draws_curved, draws_CoM) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = posterior::variables(.), names_to = "prototype", values_to = "value")

draws_prototype %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, color = prototype, fill = prototype)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4)
```

Finally, we can compare two subsets of design cells with `compare_groups`. Here,
we compare the estimates for atypical exemplars in click trials against typical 
exemplars in click trials (averaged over the three prototypical movement strategies):

```{r group-comp}
compare_groups(fit,
               higher = condition == "Atypical" & group == "click",
               lower = condition == "Typical" & group == "click"
               )
```

If one of two group specifications is left out, we compare against the grand mean:

```{r group-comp-grand-mean}
compare_groups(fit,
               higher = group == "click"
               )
```

If the Boolean flag `include_bf` is set to `TRUE` (default is `FALSE`), Bayes Factors 
for the inequality (higher > lower) are approximated in comparison to the "negated hypothesis" 
(lower <= higher). However, this requires specifying proper priors for all parameters:

```{r model-fitting-with-priors, results='hide'}
fit_with_priors <- brms::brm(formula = log(RT) ~ group * condition * prototype_label,
                             prior = prior(student_t(1, 0, 3), class = "b"),
                             data = data,
                             seed = 123
                             )
```

```{r group-comp-with-bf}
compare_groups(fit_with_priors,
               higher = prototype_label != "straight",
               lower = prototype_label == "straight",
               include_bf = TRUE
               )
```
