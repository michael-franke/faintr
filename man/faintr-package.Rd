\title{Factor Interpreter for Bayesian Regression Models}
\description{
The \pkg{faintr} (FActorINTerpreteR) package provides convenience functions
for evaluating Bayesian regression models for factorial designs, fitted with
the \pkg{brms} package. The \pkg{faintr} package allows for the extraction of
many meaningful comparisons irrespective of the encoding scheme initially used
in the model.
}
\details{
The package provides the following functions:

\code{\link{get_cell_definitions}} returns information about the factors
and their internal encoding scheme used in the regression model. It does
so by extracting a minimal design matrix from the model.

\code{\link{extract_cell_draws}} uses the cell definitions returned by
\code{\link{get_cell_definitions}} to extract posterior draws based on
a user-defined subset of factorial design cells. If no subset is passed,
the function returns draws for the grand mean.

\code{\link{compare_groups}} calls \code{\link{extract_cell_draws}} on
two subsets of cells and returns summary statistics of the group comparison,
such as the mean difference and its credible interval.

For more information on how to use \pkg{faintr}, see \code{vignette("faintr_basics")}.
}
\note{
The \pkg{faintr} package currently does not support multivariate models and
models that use families \code{categorical}, \code{dirichlet}, \code{multinomial},
and \code{logistic_normal}. Furthermore, models must not include special effect
terms \code{mo()}, \code{mi()}, \code{me()}, and \code{cs()} for fixed effects.
Also note that \pkg{faintr} currently does not support models where the intercept
is a population-level parameter (class \code{b}), as is the case when using the
\code{0 + Intercept} syntax in the \code{brm} function call.
